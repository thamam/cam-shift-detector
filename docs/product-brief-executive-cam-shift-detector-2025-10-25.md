# Product Brief: Stage 3 Validation Framework
## Executive Summary (Condensed)

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Author:** Tomer
**Status:** Draft for PM Review
**Document Type:** Executive Summary (3-Page Condensed Brief)

## üéØ Strategic Overview

**Product Concept:**

The Stage 3 Validation Framework validates the camera shift detection algorithm against real DAF agricultural site imagery, providing quantifiable performance metrics and go/no-go decision data for production deployment.

**The Critical Gap:**

Epic 1 achieved 100% detection on synthetic data, but synthetic success does not guarantee real-world performance. Production deployment without validation carries unacceptable risk of operational failure and stakeholder trust erosion.

**Strategic Importance:**

Stage 3 is the **final gate** before production deployment (Sprint 2). Without this validation:
- Production rollout remains blocked
- Unknown probability of production failure
- DAF operators cannot trust system reliability

**Success Definition:**

1. "The detector works reliably on real DAF imagery"
2. "We have quantifiable performance benchmarks on production hardware"

This provides the **go/no-go decision data** to approve Sprint 2 (24/7 monitoring, pilot rollout).

|-----------|------|----------------|
| **DAF Operators** | Confidence in alert reliability before workflow integration | ‚â•90% willing to integrate based on validation report |
| **System Admins** | Performance benchmarks for deployment planning | Complete performance profile (FPS, memory, CPU) |
| **Decision-Makers** | Quantifiable evidence for production approval | Clear go/no-go recommendation with supporting data |

## üéØ Goals and KPIs

### Primary KPIs (Gate Criteria)

| KPI | Target | Measurement |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| **Detection Accuracy** | ‚â•95% on real DAF imagery | Ground truth comparison across 50 sample images |

| **Memory Usage** | ‚â§500 MB | Resource tracking during operation |

### Business Objectives

- **Validate real-world performance** ‚Üí Detection accuracy ‚â•95% or documented gap analysis
- **Enable go/no-go decision** ‚Üí Documented recommendation with quantifiable evidence
- **Unblock production deployment** ‚Üí Sprint 2 approved to begin

## üì¶ MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **Real Data Loader** | Ingest 50 DAF images from 3 sites (OF_JERUSALEM, CARMIT, GAD) |
| **Validation Test Harness** | Execute detector, compare to ground truth, calculate accuracy |
| **Performance Profiler** | Measure FPS, memory, CPU on target hardware |
| **Validation Runner** | Single command executes complete validation suite |
| **Validation Report** | JSON + text report with metrics and go/no-go recommendation |

### Explicitly Out of Scope (Deferred)

- Ground truth annotation tool (manual annotation for 50 images)
- Continuous monitoring integration (production feature - Sprint 2)
- Alert system (production feature - Sprint 2)
- Multi-site parallel execution (sequential sufficient for 50 images)
- Advanced failure analysis (basic identification sufficient)
- Web-based dashboard (text/JSON reports adequate)

### MVP Success Criteria

1. ‚úÖ Validation executed across all 50 sample images
2. ‚úÖ Metrics documented (accuracy, false positives, FPS, memory)
3. ‚úÖ Go/no-go recommendation with supporting evidence
4. ‚úÖ Failure modes cataloged (if any) with examples
5. ‚úÖ Sprint 2 unblocked with sufficient decision data

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Platform Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Environment** | Linux production environment |
| **Memory** | 500 MB maximum constraint |
| **Processing** | CPU-only (edge deployment), 1 frame per 60 seconds |
| **Data Access** | `/home/thh3/data/greenpipe/` imagery (50 samples) |
| **Output** | JSON (machine-readable) + Markdown (human-readable) |

### Technology Stack

**Existing (Reuse from Epic 1):**
- Core detection: Affine transformation model with SIFT
- Image processing: OpenCV, NumPy
- Python 3.8+ runtime

**New (Minimal Additions):**
- Performance profiling: `time`, `memory_profiler`, `psutil` (CPU-focused)
- Ground truth: Simple JSON format

### Architecture

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Real-world accuracy < 95%** | Medium | High | Document failure modes, create algorithm refinement epic |
| **Ground truth annotation bottleneck** | Low | Medium | Start with subset (10-20 images), expand if needed |
| **Performance issues** | Low | High | Test early on equivalent hardware, optimize if needed |
| **Timeline slip** | Low | High | Ruthless scope control, defer enhancements |

**Critical Risk Insight:** If validation reveals performance gap, Stage 3 succeeds by identifying the gap before production deployment. The framework provides decision data regardless of detector performance.
