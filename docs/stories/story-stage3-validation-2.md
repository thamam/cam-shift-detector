## Dev Notes

### Technical Summary

**Objective:** Implement the core validation logic that executes the camera shift detector against real DAF imagery, systematically compares results with ground truth, and profiles system performance on target hardware.

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- **Detector Integration:** Use existing `CameraMovementDetector` API from Epic 1 (src/camera_movement_detector.py)
- **Execution Model:** Sequential processing (50 images, ~60 seconds per image = ~50 minutes total)
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation - log detection failures but continue validation
- **Performance Measurement:** Real-time profiling using psutil (system resource monitoring)
- **Metrics Precision:** Float values with 4 decimal places for accuracy reporting

**Critical Path Items:**
- Test harness must reuse Epic 1 detector without modifications
- Performance profiling must run on Linux production-equivalent hardware (500 MB RAM)
- Metrics calculation must match industry standards (TP, TN, FP, FN definitions)

**Integration Points:**
- Depends on Story 1 outputs: `RealDataLoader`, `ground_truth.json`
- Provides inputs for Story 3: Detection results, performance metrics for report generation

### Project Structure Notes

- **Files to create:**
  - `validation/stage3_test_harness.py` (~200-250 lines)
  - `validation/performance_profiler.py` (~150-200 lines)
  - `tests/validation/test_harness.py` (~150-200 lines)
  - `tests/validation/test_performance.py` (~100-150 lines)

- **Files to modify:**
  - None (pure additive - no changes to existing Epic 1 codebase)

- **Expected test locations:**
  - `tests/validation/test_harness.py` - Test harness unit tests
  - `tests/validation/test_performance.py` - Performance profiler unit tests

- **Estimated effort:** 5 story points (3 days: 2 days implementation, 0.5 day testing, 0.5 day verification on hardware)
