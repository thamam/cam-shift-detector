# Story: Validation Execution & Results Analysis

Status: Draft

## Story

As a **release engineer**,
I want **to execute the Stage 3 validation framework and analyze real-world performance metrics**,
so that **I have quantifiable data to make an informed go/no-go decision for v0.1.0 release**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC1: Validation Execution Successful**
- [ ] `python validation/run_stage3_validation.py` executes without errors
- [ ] All 50 DAF images processed successfully
- [ ] No crashes or runtime exceptions during execution
- [ ] Validation completes within expected time (< 60 minutes)

**AC2: Validation Reports Generated**
- [ ] JSON report generated in `validation/results/validation_report_*.json`
- [ ] Markdown report generated in `validation/results/validation_report_*.md`
- [ ] Both reports contain complete metrics (accuracy, FPR, FPS, memory)
- [ ] Reports include per-site breakdown for all 3 DAF sites
- [ ] Go/no-go recommendation clearly stated in reports

**AC3: Performance Metrics Documented**
- [ ] Detection accuracy measured and recorded
- [ ] False positive rate calculated
- [ ] False negative rate calculated
- [ ] Processing speed (FPS) benchmarked
- [ ] Memory usage profiled
- [ ] All metrics compared against gate criteria thresholds

**AC4: Results Analysis Completed**
- [ ] Go/no-go decision extracted from validation report
- [ ] Performance gaps identified (if any gate failures)
- [ ] Failure modes analyzed (if applicable)
- [ ] Recommendations documented for next steps
- [ ] Results summary added to project documentation

## Tasks / Subtasks

**Phase 1: Pre-Execution Verification**
- [ ] Verify all 50 sample images present in `sample_images/`
- [ ] Verify ground truth annotations exist and are valid
- [ ] Verify validation framework components accessible
- [ ] Check available system resources (disk space, memory)

**Phase 2: Validation Execution (Background/Async)**
- [ ] Execute: `python validation/run_stage3_validation.py`
- [ ] Monitor execution progress (can run in background)
- [ ] Capture any console output or warnings
- [ ] Wait for completion (estimated 30-60 minutes)

**Phase 3: Report Verification**
- [ ] Verify JSON report exists and is valid JSON
- [ ] Verify Markdown report exists and is readable
- [ ] Check all required sections present in reports
- [ ] Verify metrics calculated correctly
- [ ] Confirm go/no-go recommendation present

**Phase 4: Results Analysis**
- [ ] Review accuracy metrics (target: ≥95%)
- [ ] Review false positive rate (target: ≤5%)
- [ ] Review processing speed (target: ≥0.0167 FPS)
- [ ] Review memory usage (target: ≤500 MB)
- [ ] Identify any gate failures
- [ ] Document analysis findings

**Phase 5: Documentation Update**
- [ ] Add validation results summary to README or docs/
- [ ] Update workflow status with validation completion
- [ ] Document any issues discovered
- [ ] Create action items for any failures (if needed)

## Dev Notes

### Technical Summary

**Objective:** Execute the complete Stage 3 validation workflow to obtain real-world performance metrics on the 50 DAF sample images, providing quantifiable data for release readiness assessment.

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- **Async Execution:** Validation can run in background while other release prep work continues
- **Results Location:** `validation/results/` directory will contain timestamped reports
- **Analysis Priority:** Focus on go/no-go decision first, detailed metrics second
- **Gate Criteria:** Conservative thresholds (ANY failure → NO-GO)

**Critical Path Items:**
- Validation execution time (~30-60 min) enables parallel work on Stories 2 & 3
- Results must be available before final release decision
- Performance metrics inform integration guide documentation

**Integration Points:**
- Story 2: Validation results inform integration documentation examples
- Story 3: Go/no-go decision determines release readiness

### Execution Strategy

**Start Immediately (Background):**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run validation (let it complete)
cd /home/thh3/personal/cam-shift-detector
python validation/run_stage3_validation.py

# Terminal 2: Continue with Stories 2 & 3 in parallel
```

**Expected Outputs:**
- `validation/results/validation_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`
- `validation/results/validation_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`

**Estimated Effort:** 1 story point (30 min setup + 30-60 min execution + 30 min analysis)
