## Dev Notes

### Technical Summary

**Objective:** Prepare professional package metadata and release artifacts for v0.1.0, ensuring the module is properly packaged and can be distributed/installed following Python packaging standards.

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- **Packaging Standard:** PEP 621 with pyproject.toml (modern Python packaging)
- **Build System:** setuptools via `python -m build`
- **License:** MIT recommended for open source simplicity (to be confirmed)
- **Versioning:** 0.1.0 indicates initial release with core functionality
- **Distribution:** Source dist (.tar.gz) + wheel (.whl)

**Critical Path Items:**
- pyproject.toml metadata enables proper package identification
- LICENSE file required for legal distribution
- CHANGELOG provides release history and feature documentation
- Installation testing validates package can be consumed by users

**Integration Points:**
- Complements Story 2 installation documentation
- May reference Story 1 validation results in CHANGELOG
- Enables actual package distribution if validation passes

### Package Structure Best Practices

**Required Files:**
```
cam-shift-detector/
├── pyproject.toml      (package metadata)
├── LICENSE             (legal distribution)
├── CHANGELOG.md        (release history)
├── README.md           (project overview)
├── MANIFEST.in         (include non-Python files)
├── src/                (source code)
│   └── __init__.py
├── validation/         (validation framework)
│   └── __init__.py
└── tests/              (test suite)
```

**Optional but Recommended:**
- `setup.py` or `setup.cfg` (if needed for compatibility)
- `.gitignore` (exclude build artifacts)
- `tox.ini` or `noxfile.py` (test automation)

### Estimated Effort

**Story Points:** 1 point (1-2 hours: 30 min metadata, 30 min license/changelog, 30 min testing)

**Parallel Execution:** This story can run in parallel with Story 2 (integration guide) as they have minimal dependencies.

### License Recommendations

**MIT License (Recommended):**
- ✅ Simple and permissive
- ✅ Widely used and understood
- ✅ Compatible with commercial use
- ✅ Minimal legal complexity

**Apache 2.0:**
- ✅ Includes patent grant
- ✅ More explicit about contributions
- ⚠️ More verbose license text

**Proprietary/Closed Source:**
- ⚠️ If not distributing publicly
- ⚠️ Requires custom license text
