# Story: Integration, Reporting & Quality Assurance

Status: Complete

## Story

As a **validation engineer and decision-maker**,

## Dev Notes

### Technical Summary

**Objective:** Integrate all Stage 3 validation components into a single automated workflow, generate comprehensive reports, and provide a clear go/no-go recommendation for production deployment.

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- **Orchestration Pattern:** Sequential execution with checkpoints (fail-fast where appropriate)
- **Report Formats:** JSON (machine-readable for tooling) + Markdown (human-readable for stakeholders)
- **Decision Logic:** Rule-based evaluation against defined gate criteria (no subjective assessment)
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation - log errors but attempt to complete validation where possible
- **Exit Codes:** Standard Unix conventions (0=success, 1=validation failure, 2=execution error)

**Critical Path Items:**
- Reports must be self-contained and understandable without additional context
- Go/no-go decision must be defensible based on quantifiable metrics
- Validation runner should be executable with minimal configuration

**Integration Points:**
- Depends on Story 1: Data loader, ground truth
- Depends on Story 2: Test harness, performance profiler
- Outputs: Validation reports that enable Sprint 2 decision
