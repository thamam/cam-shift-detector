## Epic Overview

**Epic:** Stage 3 Real-World Validation System

**Epic Slug:** stage3-validation

**Goal:** Provide quantifiable confidence in camera shift detector performance on real DAF agricultural imagery, enabling data-driven production deployment decisions.

**Strategic Value:** This epic bridges the critical gap between synthetic validation success (Epic 1: 100% detection rate) and production deployment readiness. It transforms theoretical algorithm correctness into measurable real-world reliability, unblocking Sprint 2 (24/7 monitoring, alerting, pilot rollout).

- Ground truth annotation infrastructure and manual annotation process
- Validation test harness with detection execution and accuracy measurement
- Performance profiling system (FPS, memory, CPU benchmarks)
- Automated validation runner orchestrating complete workflow
- JSON and Markdown report generation with go/no-go recommendations
- Failure analysis and documentation framework

**Explicitly Excluded (Sprint 2 Scope):**
- Production 24/7 continuous monitoring system
- Real-time alerting and notification infrastructure
- Multi-site parallel execution optimization
- Ground truth annotation UI/tool (manual annotation for MVP)
- Web-based dashboard for results visualization

### Success Criteria

**Technical Gate Criteria:**
1. ✅ Detection accuracy ≥95% on 50 real DAF images
2. ✅ False positive rate ≤5% (acceptable alert tolerance)
3. ✅ Processing performance ≥1 frame per 60 seconds (1/60 Hz)
4. ✅ Memory usage ≤500 MB (production hardware constraint)
5. ✅ All 50 sample images processed without errors
6. ✅ Framework integrity tests passing (100% test coverage on validation logic)

**Deliverables:**
1. ✅ Complete validation framework codebase (`validation/` directory)
2. ✅ Ground truth annotations (50 images manually labeled)
3. ✅ JSON validation report (machine-readable metrics)
4. ✅ Markdown validation report (stakeholder-ready summary)
5. ✅ Go/no-go recommendation with supporting evidence
6. ✅ Failure mode documentation (if applicable)
7. ✅ Technical specification document (tech-spec.md)

### Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies:**
- **Epic 1 Complete:** Core detection system (CameraMovementDetector API) ✅
