## Quick Reference

- All BMAD rules are Manual type - reference them explicitly when needed
- Agents provide persona-based assistance with specific expertise
- Tasks are reusable workflows for common operations
- Each agent includes an activation block for proper initialization

## Configuration

BMAD rules are configured as Manual rules (alwaysApply: false) to give you control
over when they're included in your context. Reference them explicitly when you need
specific agent expertise or task workflows.
