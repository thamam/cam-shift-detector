Apply preliminary annotations for testing purposes.

⚠️  IMPORTANT: These are PRELIMINARY annotations for testing infrastructure only.
    Manual review of all 50 images is REQUIRED before production use.

Rationale for preliminary annotations:
- DAF imagery is from fixed security cameras (stable mounting)
- Stage 2 validation: 97.58% detection rate (33 false negatives in 1900 frames)
- Conservative assumption: Most sample images are stable (no camera shift)
- Allows infrastructure testing while manual review is pending
