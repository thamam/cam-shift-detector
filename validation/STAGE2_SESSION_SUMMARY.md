# Stage 2 Validation Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Story**: 1.9 - Validation Testing
**Tasks Completed**: Tasks 4-5 (Stage 2 Test Data Preparation & Execution)
**Status**: ❌ FAILED - AC-1.9.2 NOT SATISFIED

---

## Executive Summary

Stage 2 temporal sequence validation has **FAILED** with an **88.71% detection rate**, missing the 100% requirement by **11.29 points**. The detector correctly identifies spatial transformations (Stage 1: 95.59% ✅) but struggles with temporal dynamics, particularly:

1. **Recovery patterns** (73.3% detection) - Premature VALID status during displacement decrease
2. **One catastrophic baseline failure** (0% detection) - Baseline image 00018752 causes complete detector failure
3. **Threshold boundary issues** persist in temporal context despite Stage 1 adjustment
4. **154 false negatives** across 1,364 expected detections

**Decision**: Stage 3-9 BLOCKED pending Stage 2 remediation. NO-GO for production deployment.

## Failure Analysis

### Root Cause #1: Recovery Pattern Catastrophic Failure (73.3% detection)

**Impact**: 56/154 false negatives (36% of all failures)

**Pattern Description**: Displacement decreasing from 5px → 0px over 30 frames

**Problem**: System prematurely transitions to VALID status during displacement decrease

**Hypothesis**:
1. Detector may use frame-to-frame delta instead of cumulative displacement
2. Confidence scoring may degrade for decreasing movement direction
3. Lack of hysteresis allows rapid status flipping

**Evidence**:
- Worst performer across all patterns (26.7% miss rate)
- Consistent failures across all 10 recovery sequences
- All sequences show premature VALID transitions

**Recommendation**: HIGH PRIORITY - Debug displacement calculation logic for decreasing movements

---

### Root Cause #2: Baseline Image Complete Failure (00018752)

**Impact**: 29 false negatives in one sequence (19% of all failures)

**Image**: `sample_images/gad/00018752-d1e8-44fb-9cba-5107c18eb386.jpg`

**Problem**: Complete detector failure for this specific baseline image

**Symptoms**:
- Sudden onset sequence: 0% detection (29/29 frames missed)
- Gradual onset sequence: 76.2% detection (10 FN)
- Latency: 999 frames (no detection ever triggered)

**Hypothesis**:
1. Image may have insufficient ORB features for matching
2. Feature extraction may fail silently during initialization
3. Homography estimation may be unstable for this scene

**Recommendation**: IMMEDIATE - Investigate baseline image validation and feature extraction

---

### Root Cause #3: Threshold Boundary Persistence (92.9% detection)

**Impact**: 30 false negatives in gradual onset sequences

**Pattern Description**: Linear drift 0→5px over 60 frames (threshold crossing around frame 18)

**Problem**: Measurements near 1.5px threshold not reliably detected

**Evidence**:
- Similar to Stage 1 issue despite threshold adjustment from 2.0px → 1.5px
- Failures concentrated around threshold crossing frames (frames 17-20)
- Sub-pixel measurement noise still causing misclassification

**Hypothesis**:
1. ORB feature matching has ±0.5px measurement uncertainty
2. Homography estimation noise at small displacement scales
3. 1.5px threshold may still be too close to detection limit

**Recommendation**: MODERATE PRIORITY - Consider further threshold reduction to 1.2px

---

### Root Cause #4: Progressive Accumulation Issues (81.2% detection)

**Impact**: 12 false negatives in progressive sequences

**Pattern Description**: 0.5px incremental steps every 4 frames

**Problem**: Small incremental changes not accumulating correctly

**Hypothesis**:
1. Detector may smooth or filter measurements, losing small changes
2. Frame-to-frame comparisons may reset accumulation
3. Insufficient temporal integration window

**Evidence**:
- Worst performance after recovery pattern (18.8% miss rate)
- Failures during early accumulation phase (frames 8-16)

**Recommendation**: MODERATE PRIORITY - Verify cumulative displacement calculation

---

### Root Cause #5: Oscillation Rapid Transition Issues (90.7% detection)

**Impact**: 13 false negatives during vibration

**Pattern Description**: Sinusoidal ±3px oscillation

**Problem**: Rapid transitions or zero-crossings missed

**Evidence**:
- 9.3% miss rate during high-frequency movement
- Failures likely at peaks and zero-crossings
- Some sequences perfect, others have 2-3 FN

**Recommendation**: LOW PRIORITY (relative to other issues) - May be inherent limitation

---

## Comparison: Stage 1 vs Stage 2

| Metric | Stage 1 (Spatial) | Stage 2 (Temporal) | Delta |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Overall Accuracy** | 95.59% ✅ | 88.71% ❌ | -6.88 points |
| **AC Status** | PASS (>95%) | FAIL (<100%) | BLOCKED |
| **False Negatives** | 54 / 1225 (4.41%) | 154 / 1364 (11.29%) | +6.88 points |
| **False Positives** | 0 / 50 (0%) | 350 / 536 (65.3%) | +65.3 points |
| **Threshold Used** | 1.5px (adjusted from 2.0px) | 1.5px (same) | No change |
| **Processing Rate** | 27.6 fps | 25.3 fps | -8.3% |

**Key Insight**: Detector performs adequately on isolated frames (Stage 1) but struggles with temporal dynamics (Stage 2), suggesting:
1. State management issues across frames
2. Lack of temporal filtering or hysteresis
3. Algorithm designed for spatial comparison, not temporal tracking

---

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Investigation (Days 1-2)

**Priority 1**: Investigate Baseline Image 00018752
```bash
# Check feature extraction
python -c "
import cv2
from src.camera_movement_detector import CameraMovementDetector

detector = CameraMovementDetector('config.json')
img = cv2.imread('sample_images/gad/00018752-d1e8-44fb-9cba-5107c18eb386.jpg')
detector.set_baseline(img)
print(f'Baseline features: {detector.baseline_features}')
print(f'Feature count: {len(detector.baseline_kp) if hasattr(detector, \"baseline_kp\") else \"N/A\"}')
"

# Expected: Verify feature count meets min_features_required (50)
# If < 50: Implement baseline validation to reject insufficient images
```

**Priority 2**: Debug Recovery Pattern Logic
```python
# Add detailed logging to camera_movement_detector.py:
# - Log cumulative displacement calculation
# - Log frame-to-frame delta vs cumulative comparison
# - Log confidence scoring for decreasing movement

# Test with synthetic recovery sequence manually
```

### Phase 2: Threshold Adjustment Test (Days 3-4)

**Test**: Reduce threshold from 1.5px → 1.2px

**Validation Steps**:
1. Update `config.json`: `"threshold_pixels": 1.2`
2. Re-run Stage 1 validation: `python validation/run_stage1_validation.py`
   - **Required**: Accuracy ≥95% (AC-1.9.1)
3. If Stage 1 passes, re-run Stage 2: `python validation/run_stage2_validation.py`
   - **Required**: Detection rate = 100% (AC-1.9.2)

**Expected Outcome**: Address 30 gradual onset FN, partial improvement on other patterns

### Phase 3: Algorithm Enhancement (Week 2+)

**Option A**: Implement Temporal Filtering
- Moving average over 3-5 frame window
- Reduces measurement noise
- May improve threshold boundary detection

**Option B**: Add Hysteresis for Status Transitions
- Require 2-3 consecutive frames to confirm status change
- Prevents premature VALID transitions during recovery
- Increases robustness at cost of 1-2 frame latency

**Option C**: Feature Matching Robustness
- Increase ORB features from current count
- Implement RANSAC parameter tuning
- Apply subpixel refinement to homography

### Phase 4: Re-Validation

After remediation, re-execute full validation sequence:
1. Stage 1 validation (spatial accuracy ≥95%)
2. Stage 2 validation (temporal detection = 100%)
3. Only proceed to Stage 3 if both pass

## Blocker Impact

### Tasks 6-9: BLOCKED

**Task 6-7**: Stage 3 Pilot Site Preparation and Live Monitoring
- **Blocker**: AC-1.9.2 not satisfied
- **Rationale**: Cannot deploy detector with 88.71% detection rate to production
- **Risk**: 11.29% of camera movements would go undetected in live deployment

**Task 8**: Results Analysis and Documentation
- **Partial**: Can document Stage 1-2 results (already done)
- **Blocker**: Cannot complete comprehensive validation report without Stage 3 data

**Task 9**: Go/No-Go Decision and Recommendations
- **Current Decision**: ❌ NO-GO
- **Blocker**: Stage 2 failure prevents production readiness assessment
- **Required**: All ACs (1.9.1, 1.9.2, 1.9.3) must be satisfied for GO decision
